# The Waycross Inn
> “It’s an RPG about running a medieval fantasy Tavern, and It’s going to be a bit like ‘King of Dragon Pass’.”

## What is this?
In April 2015, Stew Hogarth of Smiling Bag games started working on a project called "The Waycross Inn". 
He kept a diary of his progress;
http://www.smilingbag.co.uk/waycrossinndevdiaryone/

Due to creative block Stew parked the project in June of the same year to work on other projects. Sadly
Stew passed away in September of the same year and so the Waycross Inn became the game he never 
finished but it was one that many people, myself included, really believed in. 

Therefore, by way of honouring Stew, this project here represents my attempt to finish the game
he started.

## The Challenges
* I am not a game developer, but I am a web developer, so I'm doing it as a web app. 
* I am not a game designer.
* All we have to go on is Stew's diaries. 
* Stew parked this project becuse he hit creative block - whatever dead end he ran into, we may run into the same one.

## Aren't you worried about failing
No. Even if I do, the man himself said the following;
> All the feelings you’re feeling, they’re caused by your own perception of the situation

I do not care if I fail. Stew would not care if I fail. Plus I am roping some friends in to help, 
and I'm pretty sure they won't care if we fail. It's not about failing - it's about trying.
